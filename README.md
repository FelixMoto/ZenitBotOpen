# ZenitBot
Telegram bot to inform people on opening hours of the climbing gym. Maybe other features will be added in the future

Currently running on my uberspace

To Do:
* need to find group chat ids so that the bot can automatically post changed opening times into the group without being asked
  /echo command can print or maybe save chat_id so it can be looked up
  OR: precific users can give the bot chat ids which it remebers and then continues to post there!
